# Predictive Model for Online Learning Performance

## Introduction

The prevalence of online learning has experienced a significant surge, providing a convenient avenue for individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge in the age of the internet. However, the autonomy required in online learning presents challenges for students who must independently motivate and regulate their learning processes. A crucial question emerges: How can we identify and provide support to students at risk of dropping out or failing in online courses? This question forms the core focus of our data science project.

The primary objective of this initiative is to construct a predictive model capable of categorizing students' performance in online courses based on their interactions within the learning environment. By leveraging historical data from prior student cohorts engaged in diverse online courses, such as coding fundamentals, data science, and machine learning, the model will undergo validation using the current cohort to assess its accuracy and reliability.
